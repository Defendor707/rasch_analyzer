# Rasch Model Telegram Bot

## Overview
Telegram bot for performing Rasch model analysis on dichotomous test data. The bot accepts CSV/Excel files, runs Rasch model analysis using Python's girth library (MML estimation), and returns professional PDF reports with item difficulties, person abilities, and reliability statistics.

- Comparable to R's TAM package `tam.cmle()` function
- Python implementation chosen for reliability in cloud environment

- Reliability (person separation)
- Descriptive statistics

## Future Enhancements (Possible)
- Support for polytomous models (PCM, RSM)
- Data visualization in PDF (Wright maps, ICC curves)
- Multiple model comparison
- Item fit statistics
- DIF detection
